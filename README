Termite is a generic distributed compilation system.

The master distributes the compilation to workers.  Workers run
arbitrary binaries chrooted in a FUSE mirror of the master's file
system, and then ship the results back to the master.


CAVEATS

Work in progress.  Do not use on machines shared with untrusted users


INSTALL

Get

  git clone git://github.com/hanwen/go-fuse.git
  git clone git://github.com/hanwen/termite.git
  (cd go-fuse && sh all.bash)

  cd termite
    ln -s ../go-fuse/fuse ../go-fuse/unionfs .
    sh all.bash


I do not goinstall go-fuse, since I develop go-fuse in tandem with
termite, but with some tweaks to the Makefile it should work.

Testing:

  ./worker.sh >& worker.log &
  ./master.sh >& master.log &
  export TERMITE_SOCKET=/tmp/termite-socket
  export PATH=/tmp/tools/termite:${PATH}
  make -j20
